# Objective:

Detecting false real estate transactions, i.e. anomalous lines in a listing of real estate transactions (fictitious data set) represented by their characteristics.

# Instructions:

You have a good.csv file that contains the data of real estate transactions without anomalies and an eval.csv file in which 50 anomalies are hidden, whose characteristics have not been not consistent.
Your goal is to use these two files to isolate 50 potential anomalies in the file eval.csv
